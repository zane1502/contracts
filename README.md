   Perpetuals Exchange on Stellar / Soroban
```

---

SO4.market is a decentralised perpetuals and spot exchange built on [Stellar](https://stellar.org) using [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org) smart contracts (SDK 25, Rust).

The protocol implements an isolated-market LP model with two-step keeper execution, dynamic funding rates, borrowing fees, price impact curves, auto-deleveraging, and on-chain liquidations — all adapted faithfully to Soroban's execution environment.

---

## Current Scope

This repository is the Soroban contracts package for the SO4.market GMX Synthetics port. The community issue campaign is over; treat `issues_v2.md` as a historical backlog, not as the source of live project truth.

### v1 contracts scope

| Area | v1 status |
|---|---|
| Isolated markets, LP mint/burn, deposits, withdrawals | In scope |
| Market, limit, stop, and swap order lifecycle | In scope |
| Liquidation, ADL execution, fee claiming, referral storage | In scope |
| Reader views and router multicall | In scope |
| Custom keeper-signed oracle prices | In scope |
| Testnet deployment, token bootstrap, and operator Make workflows | In scope |

### Deferred or non-v1 scope

| Area | Decision |
|---|---|
| Pyth VAA oracle ingestion | Deferred. v1 uses the custom keeper-signature oracle path. |
| Full production frontend and indexer | Deferred from this contracts repository. |
| On-chain governance/timelock | Deferred; production admin policy should use Stellar native multisig. |
| Broad contract mutability | Rejected for v1. Only contracts with actual Rust `upgrade` entrypoints are upgradeable. |

### Intentional GMX-to-Soroban deviations

| GMX Synthetics concept | SO4 Soroban implementation |
|---|---|
| EVM ERC-20 token interactions | SEP-41 token clients and Stellar Asset Contracts. |
| Global Solidity data store for most structs | Handler-local persistent storage for deposits, withdrawals, orders, and positions; `data_store` remains for config, pool accounting, lists, and shared values. |
| Oracle integration | Ledger-scoped keeper-submitted prices with ed25519 signature verification; test helpers are excluded from production builds. |
| Router execution shape | Soroban-friendly multicall with explicit token-send actions before request creation. |
| Execution fees | Contract support is present where implemented, but operator economics and production keeper compensation still need final deployment policy. |

### Contract Map

| Contract | Description |
|---|---|
| `data_store` | Universal typed key-value store for market metadata, risk config, pool accounting, role-gated lists, and fee/accounting values. User requests and positions are stored locally in their handlers. |
| `role_store` | Role-based access control — CONTROLLER, MARKET_KEEPER, ORDER_KEEPER, etc. |
| `oracle` | Keeper-fed price store. Prices expire per ledger. Ed25519-verified. (Mainnet uses cryptographically signed prices only; test-only paths are excluded from production builds.) |
| `market_token` | SEP-41 LP token deployed per market by `market_factory`. |
| `market_factory` | Deterministically deploys `market_token` instances and registers markets. |
| `deposit_vault` | Holds long/short tokens between deposit creation and keeper execution. |
| `deposit_handler` | Two-step deposit lifecycle: create → (keeper) execute / cancel. |
| `withdrawal_vault` | Holds LP tokens between withdrawal creation and keeper execution. |
| `withdrawal_handler` | Two-step withdrawal lifecycle: create → (keeper) execute / cancel. |
| `order_vault` | Holds collateral for pending orders. |
| `order_handler` | Full order lifecycle with routing by `OrderType` to position/swap utils. |
| `liquidation_handler` | Force-closes under-collateralised positions (LIQUIDATION_KEEPER). |
| `adl_handler` | Auto-deleverages profitable positions when pool PnL exceeds threshold. |
| `fee_handler` | Claims accumulated protocol fees and user funding fee credits. |
| `referral_storage` | On-chain referral code registry with tier-based rebate/discount config. |
| `reader` | Read-only aggregate views: positions, markets, OI, funding, liquidation checks. Stores only upgrade admin metadata. |
| `exchange_router` | Single user entry point. Supports multicall for atomic multi-step actions. |

### Shared Libraries

| Crate | Description |
|---|---|
| `libs/types` | All shared structs: `MarketProps`, `PositionProps`, `OrderProps`, `PriceProps`, `PositionFees`, etc. |
| `libs/math` | `FLOAT_PRECISION` (10³⁰), `TOKEN_PRECISION` (10⁷), `mul_div_wide` (I256), `pow_factor`, `sqrt_fp`. |
| `libs/keys` | ~58 deterministic `sha256`-based key derivation functions. |
| `libs/market_utils` | Pool value, open interest, PnL, funding state, borrowing fees, pool/OI validation. |
| `libs/position_utils` | Per-position PnL, fee breakdown, funding settlement, leverage validation, liquidation check. |
| `libs/pricing_utils` | Swap and position price impact, execution price, impact pool management. |
| `libs/swap_utils` | Single-hop and multi-hop token swaps through market pools. |
| `libs/increase_position_utils` | Open or increase a long/short position (14-step flow). |
| `libs/decrease_position_utils` | Partial or full position close with PnL settlement (14-step flow). Accepts an optional `swap_path` — when non-empty, collateral output is swapped through the specified markets before reaching the receiver. |

---

## Key Financial Mechanics

### Price Precision
- All USD values use `FLOAT_PRECISION = 10^30`.
- All token amounts use `TOKEN_PRECISION = 10^7` (Stellar's 7-decimal standard).
- Wide multiplication via Soroban's `I256` host functions prevents overflow.

### LP Minting
```
mint_amount        = deposit_usd × TOKEN_PRECISION / market_token_price
market_token_price = pool_value / lp_supply  (1 USD on first deposit)
```

### Price Impact
```
initial_diff = |sideA_usd - sideB_usd|
next_diff    = |after_delta|
positive_impact (improves balance) → paid from impact pool, capped by pool balance
negative_impact (worsens balance)  → paid into impact pool
impact = factor × (diff ^ exponent)
```

### Funding Rate
```
funding_factor_per_second = funding_factor × (|long_oi - short_oi| / total_oi) ^ exponent
funding_amount_per_size  += factor_per_second × dt × index_token_price
```

### Borrowing Fee
```
cumulative_borrowing_factor += borrowing_factor × dt × (open_interest / pool_amount)
position_borrow_fee          = (cumulative_factor_now - factor_at_open) × size_in_tokens
```

### Liquidation
```
remaining   = collateral_usd - borrowing_fees - funding_fees + unrealised_pnl
liquidatable when: remaining < min_collateral_factor × position_size_usd
```

---

## Order Collateral Flow

> **Resolves issue #47 — Unify order collateral transfer model.**

The protocol follows a single, canonical two-step collateral path.
`exchange_router` is the only entry point that may touch a caller's tokens.
`order_handler` is a passive consumer that only reads from the vault.

### Chosen model: Router-push, Handler-snapshot

```
User
 │
 │  multicall([
 │    SendTokens { token, receiver: order_vault, amount },  ← Step 1
 │    CreateOrder { params },                               ← Step 2
 │  ])
 ▼
ExchangeRouter
 │
 ├─ Step 1: token::Client(token).transfer(caller → order_vault, amount)
 │
 └─ Step 2: OrderHandlerClient.create_order(caller, params)
               │
               └─ OrderVault.record_transfer_in(token)
                    │  snapshot = on_chain_balance − last_recorded
                    │  REVERT if snapshot ≤ 0  (ZeroCollateral)
                    └─ stores order with collateral_delta_amount = snapshot
```

**Why this model:**
- The router holds the user's token approval; keeping the pull there means
  handlers never need their own approval and cannot silently double-pull.
- `record_transfer_in` acts as a snapshot oracle: it always reflects exactly
  what arrived since the last order, so double-submission is impossible.
- Decrease / stop-loss / liquidation orders do **not** deposit collateral;
  `create_order` skips the vault snapshot for those order types.

**Balance invariant:** after every `create_order` or `transfer_out`, the vault's
DataStore recorded balance equals its actual on-chain SEP-41 balance.

---

## Keeper Trust Model and Execution Timing

> **Resolves issue #154/#125 — Document keeper execution timing and front-running design.**

### What keepers can do

Keepers are permissioned off-chain bots that hold role-store roles (`ORDER_KEEPER`,
`LIQUIDATION_KEEPER`, `ADL_KEEPER`). They observe pending requests and choose **when** to
submit the execution transaction. This gives a keeper limited influence over two variables:

1. **Oracle prices** — The keeper submits `set_prices` and `execute_order` in the same
   transaction. The oracle prices therefore reflect the market at the ledger the keeper
   chose, not the ledger the user chose.
2. **Execution timing** — A keeper can delay execution, waiting for a price movement that
   benefits them or harms the user, within the bounds of the acceptable-price window.

### What the protocol does to limit the damage

| Protection | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Acceptable price window** | Every `MarketIncrease` / `MarketDecrease` / swap order carries `acceptable_price`. `execute_order` reverts if the oracle execution price is worse than this bound. A tight window forces the keeper to execute at a fair price or not at all. |
| **Role gating** | Only accounts holding the `ORDER_KEEPER` role (assigned by admin) can call `execute_order`. Rogue keeper candidates must first compromise the admin key or role-store. |
| **Atomic price + execution** | Prices are set in the same transaction as execution. The keeper cannot front-run itself by setting prices in an earlier ledger. |
| **Price impact** | Large positions that worsens OI balance incur negative price impact, reducing the keeper's incentive to push oversized trades through. |
| **Per-market OI caps** | `MAX_OPEN_INTEREST` per market per side prevents a compromised keeper from accumulating unbounded OI that could drain the pool. |

### Known risks and latency gap

Soroban ledgers close approximately every **5–6 seconds** on the live network. The
expected keeper round-trip (observe → sign → submit → confirm) is **1–3 ledgers**. This
means a keeper may observe a price `P` at ledger `L` but execute at ledger `L+2`, when
the true price is `P′ ≠ P`.

The `acceptable_price` window is the primary mitigation. Its width is user-controlled:
a tight window (e.g. 0.1 % slippage) limits the price deviation a keeper can exploit
to that band. A user who sets `acceptable_price = 0` (no check) accepts unbounded
timing risk.

**Known residual risk:** A keeper that controls block inclusion (e.g. a validator that is
also a keeper) could theoretically execute at the worst price within the acceptable window
on every trade. The protocol does not defend against this at the smart-contract level.
Mitigation strategies — such as multiple competing keepers and keeper-reputation staking —
are operational concerns outside the current scope.

### Acceptable price guidance for order creators

| Order type | Recommended `acceptable_price` |
|---|---|
| `MarketIncrease` (long) | oracle mid-price × (1 + max_slippage) |
| `MarketIncrease` (short) | oracle mid-price × (1 − max_slippage) |
| `MarketDecrease` (long) | oracle mid-price × (1 − max_slippage) |
| `MarketDecrease` (short) | oracle mid-price × (1 + max_slippage) |
| `LimitIncrease` / `LimitDecrease` | set to trigger price (order is only executed at or better than trigger) |
| Swap orders | min output amount derived from worst-case impact + slippage |

A `max_slippage` of 0.5 %–1 % covers normal 1–3 ledger delay at typical volatility
while protecting against malicious timing within the window.

## Canonical Storage Model

> **Resolves issue #2 — Decide the canonical storage model for requests and positions.**

All transient request types (Deposits, Withdrawals, Orders) and long-lived Positions live in **handler-local persistent storage** within their respective contracts rather than in the shared global `data_store`.

### Chosen Architecture: Local Persistent Storage

```
DepositHandler      ──► (Local persistent storage: DepositProps)
WithdrawalHandler   ──► (Local persistent storage: WithdrawalProps)
OrderHandler        ──► (Local persistent storage: OrderProps & PositionProps)
```

- **Deposits**: Persisted locally in `deposit_handler` using `LocalKey::Deposit(nonce)`.
- **Withdrawals**: Persisted locally in `withdrawal_handler` using `LocalKey::Withdrawal(nonce)`.
- **Orders**: Persisted locally in `order_handler` using `OrderStorageKey::Order(nonce)`.
- **Positions**: Persisted locally in `order_handler` using `PositionStorageKey::Position(key)`.

### Rationale

1. **Storage Rent (TTL) Isolation**: Soroban requires rent (TTL) for persistent storage. Distributing user-specific transient requests (deposits, withdrawals, orders) and positions to their local handler contracts isolates their TTL management. This prevents the shared `data_store` from becoming an eviction risk or billing bottleneck.
2. **Access Control & Encapsulation**: Storing positions and orders within `order_handler` ensures that only authorized logic in `order_handler` (e.g. `create_order`, `execute_order`) can mutate position state. If stored in a shared `data_store`, any contract with write access to the `data_store` could corrupt position records.
3. **CPU Instruction / Serialization Savings**: Centralized databases like `data_store` store values in generic key-value maps. Cross-contract struct serialization/deserialization into `data_store` introduces significant CPU instruction overhead. Storing structs locally allows direct, type-safe serialization within the contract's namespace.

---

## Multi-hop Swap Semantics

> **Resolves issue #57 — Audit multi-hop swap token movement semantics.**

### Physical token movement model

Tokens move **physically** between pool contracts on every hop.
No virtual accounting shortcut is used — each intermediate transfer is
a real SEP-41 `transfer` call on-chain.

For a two-hop path `A → B → C` via `[market_1, market_2]`:

```
                 order_vault
                      │  transfer_out(token_A → market_1)
                      ▼
          ┌─── market_1 (pool: A, B) ───┐
          │  pool_A += input_A          │
          │  pool_B -= output_B         │
          │  SEP-41 transfer:           │
          │  token_B → market_2  ───────┼────────────────────┐
          └─────────────────────────────┘                    ▼
                                             ┌─── market_2 (pool: B, C) ───┐
                                             │  pool_B += output_B         │
                                             │  pool_C -= output_C         │
                                             │  SEP-41 transfer:           │
                                             │  token_C → receiver  ───────┼──► User
                                             └─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Pool balance invariant (holds after every multi-hop execution):**

| pool          | token   | DataStore record             | on-chain balance |
|---------------|---------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| market_1      | token_A | + input_A                    | + input_A       |
| market_1      | token_B | − output_B                   | − output_B      |
| market_2      | token_B | + output_B                   | + output_B      |
| market_2      | token_C | − output_C                   | − output_C      |

### Duplicate market guard

A swap path with a repeated market address causes double-mutation of pool
state and corrupts price-impact accounting.  `swap_with_path` rejects any
path with duplicate market addresses before any state is touched.

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. Rust toolchain

```bash
# Install Rust (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Add the wasm target (required for Soroban contract compilation)
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### 2. Stellar CLI

```bash
# Install from crates.io with wasm optimiser enabled
cargo install --locked stellar-cli --features opt

# Verify
stellar --version
```

### 3. Docker (optional — required for local node)

[Install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if you want to run a fully local Stellar node instead of using testnet.

---

## Keys & Identity

Every transaction on Stellar must be signed by a key pair. The CLI manages keys in a local keystore (`~/.config/stellar/identity/`).

### Generate a new key pair

```bash
# Generate and store a key named "alice" globally (persists across projects)
stellar keys generate --global alice --network testnet

# Print the public address for "alice"
stellar keys address alice

# Print the secret key (keep this safe — do not commit it)
stellar keys show alice
```

### Import an existing secret key

```bash
stellar keys add alice --secret-key
# You will be prompted to paste the secret key (starts with S...)
```

### List all stored keys

```bash
stellar keys ls
```

### Fund a key on testnet (Friendbot airdrop)

```bash
# Requests 10,000 XLM from the testnet Friendbot faucet
stellar keys fund alice --network testnet

# Verify the balance
stellar contract invoke \
  --id CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC \
  --source alice --network testnet \
  -- balance --id $(stellar keys address alice)
```

### Configure the network shorthand (optional)

```bash
# "testnet" is pre-configured. To add a custom RPC:
stellar network add localnet \
  --rpc-url http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc \
  --network-passphrase "Standalone Network ; February 2017"
```

---

## Build

### Type-check only (fastest — no wasm output)

```bash
cargo check --workspace
```

### Lint with Clippy

```bash
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
```

### Build all contracts to wasm

```bash
stellar contract build
```

Output: `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/<contract_name>.wasm`

> The `stellar contract build` command compiles every `cdylib` crate in the workspace automatically.

### Build a single contract

```bash
stellar contract build --package data-store
stellar contract build --package role-store
stellar contract build --package oracle
stellar contract build --package market-factory
stellar contract build --package deposit-handler
stellar contract build --package withdrawal-handler
stellar contract build --package order-handler
stellar contract build --package liquidation-handler
stellar contract build --package adl-handler
stellar contract build --package fee-handler
stellar contract build --package referral-storage
stellar contract build --package reader
stellar contract build --package exchange-router
```

### Optimised release build

```bash
# Adds wasm-opt shrinking pass — use this before uploading to mainnet
stellar contract build --release
```

### Inspect a compiled wasm

```bash
# Print all exported function names
stellar contract inspect \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/order_handler.wasm
```

---

## Test

All tests run inside the Soroban sandbox (no network required). The SDK provides a full mock host environment with storage, auth, and events.

### Run the full test suite

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

### Test a specific crate

```bash
# Shared libraries
cargo test -p gmx-math
cargo test -p gmx-keys
cargo test -p gmx-market-utils
cargo test -p gmx-position-utils
cargo test -p gmx-pricing-utils
cargo test -p gmx-swap-utils
cargo test -p gmx-decrease-position-utils

# Core contracts
cargo test -p data-store
cargo test -p role-store
cargo test -p oracle
cargo test -p fee-handler

# Handler contracts
cargo test -p deposit-handler
cargo test -p withdrawal-handler
cargo test -p order-handler
```

### Run a single test by name

```bash
cargo test -p gmx-market-utils apply_delta_to_pool_amount_works
cargo test -p oracle set_and_get_price
cargo test -p deposit-handler create_and_execute_deposit
```

### Show test output (disable output capture)

```bash
cargo test --workspace -- --nocapture
```

### Run tests with a filter pattern

```bash
# All tests whose name contains "deposit"
cargo test --workspace deposit
```

### Check test coverage (requires cargo-llvm-cov)

```bash
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --open
```

---

## Local Node

For end-to-end integration testing without using public testnet.

### Start a local Stellar node

```bash
stellar network start local
```

This starts a Docker container with a local Stellar + Soroban node on `http://localhost:8000`.

### Generate and fund a local key

```bash
stellar keys generate --global dev --network local
stellar keys fund dev --network local
```

### Stop the local node

```bash
stellar network stop local
```

All state is ephemeral — restarting clears everything.

---

## Makefile

A `Makefile` is provided for the most common workflows.

| Target | Description |
|---|---|
| `make build` | Compile all contracts to wasm via `stellar contract build` |
| `make check` | Type-check without producing wasm (`cargo check`) |
| `make lint` | Run Clippy with warnings as errors |
| `make test` | Run the full Soroban sandbox test suite |
| `make deploy-all` | Deploy the full protocol graph to **testnet** (default) |
| `make deploy-contract` | Deploy one standalone contract Wasm for debugging |
| `make upgrade-contract` | Upload new Wasm and upgrade one existing deployed contract |
| `make upgrade-all` | Upgrade every deployed protocol contract listed in `UPGRADE_CONTRACTS` |
| `make deploy-mainnet` | Deploy the full protocol graph to **mainnet** |
| `make clean` | Remove `target/` and `.deployed/` |

### Deploy and upgrade

```bash
# Full testnet deployment (default network)
make deploy-all

# Testnet with a different key name
make deploy-all SOURCE=mykey

# Mainnet
make deploy-mainnet SOURCE=mykey

# Override both
make deploy-all NETWORK=mainnet SOURCE=mykey

# Deploy one standalone contract Wasm for debugging
make deploy-contract CONTRACT=reader NETWORK=testnet SOURCE=mykey

# Upgrade one deployed contract in-place
make upgrade-contract CONTRACT=deposit_handler NETWORK=testnet SOURCE=mykey

# Upgrade every deployed protocol contract listed in UPGRADE_CONTRACTS
make upgrade-all NETWORK=testnet SOURCE=mykey
```

`SOURCE` must match a key stored in your local Stellar keystore (see [Keys & Identity](#keys--identity) above).

The full deploy script (`scripts/deploy.sh`) handles the full sequence automatically:
builds → uploads wasm blobs → deploys each contract → calls `initialize` → grants `CONTROLLER` roles → prints a summary table → saves all addresses to `.deployed/<NETWORK>.env`.

If `.deployed/<NETWORK>.env` already exists, `make deploy-all` refuses to create
a second protocol graph and prints the appropriate upgrade commands. To
intentionally create a fresh deployment, use:

```bash
make deploy-force NETWORK=testnet SOURCE=mykey
```

`deploy-contract` is deliberately standalone: it deploys one Wasm and prints the
new contract address, but it does not update `.deployed/<NETWORK>.env` or wire
the contract into the current protocol deployment.

Upgrade commands require the deployed contract to already expose an admin-gated
`upgrade(env, new_wasm_hash)` function that calls
`env.deployer().update_current_contract_wasm(new_wasm_hash)`.

### Deployed address file

After a successful deploy, addresses are written to `.deployed/testnet.env` (or `mainnet.env`):

```bash
# Source the file to load all contract addresses into your shell
source .deployed/testnet.env
echo $EXCHANGE_ROUTER
```

---

## Testnet Market Bootstrap

After the protocol contracts are deployed, you need to create a market, grant keeper roles, set config parameters, and seed initial liquidity before the protocol is usable. `scripts/bootstrap.sh` automates all of these steps.

### Quick start (end-to-end fresh testnet deployment)

```bash
# 1. Generate and fund keys
stellar keys generate --global alice  --network testnet
stellar keys generate --global keeper --network testnet
stellar keys fund alice  --network testnet
stellar keys fund keeper --network testnet

# 2. Create and fund test tokens (TWBTC = long, TUSDC = short)
make market-tokens NETWORK=testnet SOURCE=alice LONG_CODE=TWBTC SHORT_CODE=TUSDC

# 3. Deploy all protocol contracts
make deploy-all NETWORK=testnet SOURCE=alice

# 4. Bootstrap: grant roles, create market, set config keys
make bootstrap NETWORK=testnet SOURCE=alice KEEPER=keeper LONG_CODE=TWBTC SHORT_CODE=TUSDC

# 5. Submit initial oracle prices
bash scripts/submit_prices.sh testnet keeper

# 6. Seed the market with initial liquidity
#    (see output of make bootstrap for the exact deposit_handler invocation)
```

### Bootstrap targets

| Target | Description |
|---|---|
| `make market-tokens` | Create and fund both TWBTC and TUSDC test tokens |
| `make bootstrap` | Full post-deploy bootstrap (roles + market + config + seed instructions) |
| `make market-init` | Market creation and config only (skip role grants and seed) |
| `make seed-liquidity` | Print instructions for seeding the pool with initial liquidity |

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `KEEPER` | `$(SOURCE)` | Stellar key name for the keeper account |
| `LONG_CODE` | `TWBTC` | Ticker of the long token |
| `SHORT_CODE` | `TUSDC` | Ticker of the short token |
| `SEED_LONG` | `10000000` | Long token amount for initial liquidity seed |
| `SEED_SHORT` | `10000000` | Short token amount for initial liquidity seed |
| `SKIP_ROLES` | `0` | Set to `1` to skip role grants (idempotent re-run) |
| `SKIP_MARKET` | `0` | Set to `1` to skip market creation (already created) |
| `SKIP_CONFIG` | `0` | Set to `1` to skip config key writes |
| `SKIP_SEED` | `0` | Set to `1` to skip liquidity seed instructions |

### What the bootstrap script does

1. **Grant keeper roles** — grants `MARKET_KEEPER`, `ORDER_KEEPER`, `LIQUIDATION_KEEPER`, `ADL_KEEPER`, and `FEE_KEEPER` roles to the keeper account in `role_store`.
2. **Create market** — calls `market_factory.create_market(index_token, long_token, short_token)` and saves the new `MARKET_TOKEN` address to `.deployed/<NETWORK>.env`.
3. **Set config keys** — writes per-market config parameters (`max_pool_amount`, `min_collateral_factor`, `max_leverage`, fee factors, borrowing factors, funding factors) to `data_store`.
4. **Seed instructions** — prints the manual steps for seeding initial liquidity, since the oracle must be running first.

### Repeatable and idempotent

The bootstrap can be re-run safely with `SKIP_*` flags for the steps already completed:

```bash
# Re-run only config key updates for an existing market
make market-init NETWORK=testnet SOURCE=alice SKIP_ROLES=1 SKIP_SEED=1

# Re-run only role grants
make bootstrap NETWORK=testnet SOURCE=alice SKIP_MARKET=1 SKIP_CONFIG=1 SKIP_SEED=1
```

## Deploy to Testnet (manual)

The steps below are the manual equivalent of `make deploy`, useful for debugging individual steps or partial re-deploys.

Contracts must be deployed in dependency order: stores first, then handlers that depend on them, then the router last. The sequence below captures the full stack.

### Step 1 — Build wasm blobs

```bash
stellar contract build
```

### Step 2 — Upload wasm blobs

Each `upload` uploads bytecode and returns a `WASM_HASH`. Record each one — the hash is stable as long as the code doesn't change, so you only need to re-upload after rebuilding.

```bash
ROLE_STORE_HASH=$(stellar contract upload \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/role_store.wasm \
  --source alice --network testnet)

DATA_STORE_HASH=$(stellar contract upload \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/data_store.wasm \
  --source alice --network testnet)

ORACLE_HASH=$(stellar contract upload \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/oracle.wasm \
  --source alice --network testnet)

MARKET_TOKEN_HASH=$(stellar contract upload \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/market_token.wasm \
  --source alice --network testnet)

MARKET_FACTORY_HASH=$(stellar contract upload \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/market_factory.wasm \
  --source alice --network testnet)

DEPOSIT_VAULT_HASH=$(stellar contract upload \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/deposit_vault.wasm \
  --source alice --network testnet)

DEPOSIT_HANDLER_HASH=$(stellar contract upload \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/deposit_handler.wasm \
  --source alice --network testnet)

WITHDRAWAL_VAULT_HASH=$(stellar contract upload \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/withdrawal_vault.wasm \
  --source alice --network testnet)

WITHDRAWAL_HANDLER_HASH=$(stellar contract upload \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/withdrawal_handler.wasm \
  --source alice --network testnet)

ORDER_VAULT_HASH=$(stellar contract upload \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/order_vault.wasm \
  --source alice --network testnet)

ORDER_HANDLER_HASH=$(stellar contract upload \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/order_handler.wasm \
  --source alice --network testnet)

LIQUIDATION_HANDLER_HASH=$(stellar contract upload \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/liquidation_handler.wasm \
  --source alice --network testnet)

ADL_HANDLER_HASH=$(stellar contract upload \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/adl_handler.wasm \
  --source alice --network testnet)

FEE_HANDLER_HASH=$(stellar contract upload \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/fee_handler.wasm \
  --source alice --network testnet)

REFERRAL_STORAGE_HASH=$(stellar contract upload \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/referral_storage.wasm \
  --source alice --network testnet)

READER_HASH=$(stellar contract upload \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/reader.wasm \
  --source alice --network testnet)

EXCHANGE_ROUTER_HASH=$(stellar contract upload \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/exchange_router.wasm \
  --source alice --network testnet)
```

### Step 3 — Capture your admin address

```bash
ALICE=$(stellar keys address alice)
```

### Step 4 — Deploy core infrastructure

```bash
ROLE_STORE=$(stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash $ROLE_STORE_HASH \
  --source alice --network testnet \
  -- initialize --admin $ALICE)

DATA_STORE=$(stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash $DATA_STORE_HASH \
  --source alice --network testnet \
  -- initialize --admin $ALICE --role_store $ROLE_STORE)

ORACLE=$(stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash $ORACLE_HASH \
  --source alice --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
     --admin $ALICE \
     --role_store $ROLE_STORE \
     --data_store $DATA_STORE \
     --network_passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015")
```

### Step 5 — Deploy market factory

```bash
MARKET_FACTORY=$(stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash $MARKET_FACTORY_HASH \
  --source alice --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
     --admin $ALICE \
     --role_store $ROLE_STORE \
     --data_store $DATA_STORE)

stellar contract invoke --id $MARKET_FACTORY \
  --source alice --network testnet \
  -- set_market_token_wasm_hash \
     --caller $ALICE \
     --wasm_hash $MARKET_TOKEN_HASH
```

### Step 6 — Deploy vaults and handlers

```bash
DEPOSIT_VAULT=$(stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash $DEPOSIT_VAULT_HASH \
  --source alice --network testnet \
  -- initialize --admin $ALICE --role_store $ROLE_STORE)

DEPOSIT_HANDLER=$(stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash $DEPOSIT_HANDLER_HASH \
  --source alice --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
     --admin $ALICE \
     --role_store $ROLE_STORE \
     --data_store $DATA_STORE \
     --oracle $ORACLE \
     --deposit_vault $DEPOSIT_VAULT)

WITHDRAWAL_VAULT=$(stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash $WITHDRAWAL_VAULT_HASH \
  --source alice --network testnet \
  -- initialize --admin $ALICE --role_store $ROLE_STORE)

WITHDRAWAL_HANDLER=$(stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash $WITHDRAWAL_HANDLER_HASH \
  --source alice --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
     --admin $ALICE \
     --role_store $ROLE_STORE \
     --data_store $DATA_STORE \
     --oracle $ORACLE \
     --withdrawal_vault $WITHDRAWAL_VAULT)

ORDER_VAULT=$(stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash $ORDER_VAULT_HASH \
  --source alice --network testnet \
  -- initialize --admin $ALICE --role_store $ROLE_STORE)

ORDER_HANDLER=$(stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash $ORDER_HANDLER_HASH \
  --source alice --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
     --admin $ALICE \
     --role_store $ROLE_STORE \
     --data_store $DATA_STORE \
     --oracle $ORACLE \
     --order_vault $ORDER_VAULT)
```

### Step 7 — Deploy risk handlers and periphery

```bash
LIQUIDATION_HANDLER=$(stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash $LIQUIDATION_HANDLER_HASH \
  --source alice --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
     --admin $ALICE \
     --role_store $ROLE_STORE \
     --data_store $DATA_STORE \
     --oracle $ORACLE \
     --order_handler $ORDER_HANDLER)

ADL_HANDLER=$(stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash $ADL_HANDLER_HASH \
  --source alice --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
     --admin $ALICE \
     --role_store $ROLE_STORE \
     --data_store $DATA_STORE \
     --oracle $ORACLE \
     --order_handler $ORDER_HANDLER)

FEE_HANDLER=$(stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash $FEE_HANDLER_HASH \
  --source alice --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
     --admin $ALICE \
     --role_store $ROLE_STORE \
     --data_store $DATA_STORE)

REFERRAL_STORAGE=$(stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash $REFERRAL_STORAGE_HASH \
  --source alice --network testnet \
  -- initialize --admin $ALICE)

READER=$(stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash $READER_HASH \
  --source alice --network testnet \
  -- initialize --admin $ALICE)
```

### Step 8 — Deploy exchange router

```bash
EXCHANGE_ROUTER=$(stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash $EXCHANGE_ROUTER_HASH \
  --source alice --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
     --admin $ALICE \
     --role_store $ROLE_STORE \
     --data_store $DATA_STORE \
     --deposit_handler $DEPOSIT_HANDLER \
     --withdrawal_handler $WITHDRAWAL_HANDLER \
     --order_handler $ORDER_HANDLER \
     --fee_handler $FEE_HANDLER)
```

### Step 9 — Grant CONTROLLER role to all handlers

Handlers need `CONTROLLER` to write to `data_store` and withdraw from market pools:

```bash
for CONTRACT in \
  $DEPOSIT_HANDLER \
  $WITHDRAWAL_HANDLER \
  $ORDER_HANDLER \
  $LIQUIDATION_HANDLER \
  $ADL_HANDLER \
  $FEE_HANDLER \
  $EXCHANGE_ROUTER
do
  stellar contract invoke \
    --id $ROLE_STORE \
    --source alice --network testnet \
    -- grant_role --account $CONTRACT --role CONTROLLER
done
```

### Step 10 — Grant keeper roles (optional, for a test keeper account)

```bash
# Generate a dedicated keeper key
stellar keys generate --global keeper --network testnet
stellar keys fund keeper --network testnet
KEEPER=$(stellar keys address keeper)

# Market keeper (price feeds, execute deposits/withdrawals)
stellar contract invoke --id $ROLE_STORE --source alice --network testnet \
  -- grant_role --account $KEEPER --role MARKET_KEEPER

# Order keeper (execute pending orders)
stellar contract invoke --id $ROLE_STORE --source alice --network testnet \
  -- grant_role --account $KEEPER --role ORDER_KEEPER

# Liquidation keeper
stellar contract invoke --id $ROLE_STORE --source alice --network testnet \
  -- grant_role --account $KEEPER --role LIQUIDATION_KEEPER

# ADL keeper
stellar contract invoke --id $ROLE_STORE --source alice --network testnet \
  -- grant_role --account $KEEPER --role ADL_KEEPER

# Fee keeper (sweep protocol fees)
stellar contract invoke --id $ROLE_STORE --source alice --network testnet \
  -- grant_role --account $KEEPER --role FEE_KEEPER
```

## Invoke Contracts (Examples)

### Create a market
```bash
stellar contract invoke --id $MARKET_FACTORY \
  --source alice --network testnet \
  -- create_market \
     --index_token <ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS> \
     --long_token  <WETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS> \
     --short_token <USDC_TOKEN_ADDRESS>
```

### Read pool value
```bash
stellar contract invoke --id <READER_ADDRESS> \
  --source alice --network testnet \
  -- get_market_pool_value_info \
     --data_store $DATA_STORE \
     --oracle $ORACLE \
     --market_token <MARKET_TOKEN_ADDRESS> \
     --maximize false
```

### Quarantine Candidates

The following directories currently sit under `libs/` but are **not** members of
the Cargo workspace and are written against MultiversX APIs, not Soroban:

| Directory | Status |
|---|---|
| `libs/deposit_flow` | Legacy/non-Soroban issue artifact. |
| `libs/withdrawal_flow` | Legacy/non-Soroban issue artifact. |
| `libs/position_list` | Legacy/non-Soroban issue artifact. |
| `libs/storage_ttl` | Legacy/non-Soroban issue artifact. |

Do not use these as implementation references for Soroban contracts. Either port
the useful ideas into the active Soroban crates or move them to an archive in a
dedicated cleanup PR.

## Upgrade Policy

Every core contract designed to be upgradeable exposes an `upgrade(env, new_wasm_hash)` function that authenticates the stored admin before calling `env.deployer().update_current_contract_wasm(new_wasm_hash)`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Audit Finding (Code-vs-Doc Disconnect):**
> The operator workflows can upload Wasm for any contract, but only contracts with a Rust `upgrade` entrypoint can be upgraded in place. Core databases and vaults remain functionally immutable, which significantly reduces the key-compromise attack surface for the protocol.

| Contract | Upgradeable (in Rust Code) | Upgrade Authority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `data_store` | ❌ Immutable | — | Stores all protocol state. Immutability protects against raw data tampering. |
| `role_store` | ❌ Immutable | — | Access control registry. Immutability secures access credentials. |
| `market_factory` | ❌ Immutable | — | Deploys LP tokens. Cannot be upgraded. |
| `market_token` | ❌ Immutable | — | Standard SEP-41 LP token. Always immutable. |
| `oracle` | ❌ Immutable | — | Price feed consumer. Fully immutable. |
| `deposit_vault` | ❌ Immutable | — | Token custodian. Fully immutable. |
| `withdrawal_vault`| ❌ Immutable | — | LP token custodian. Fully immutable. |
| `order_vault` | ❌ Immutable | — | Collateral custodian. Fully immutable. |
| `deposit_handler` | ✅ Yes | local `admin` address | Custody handling and LP mint execution. |
| `withdrawal_handler`| ❌ Immutable | — | Fully immutable. |
| `order_handler` | ✅ Yes | local `admin` address | Trading engine (orders, positions, swaps). |
| `liquidation_handler`| ✅ Yes | local `admin` address | Triggers forced position closing. |
| `adl_handler` | ❌ Immutable | — | Fully immutable. |
| `fee_handler` | ✅ Yes | local `admin` address | Fee claiming and UI-fee config. |
| `referral_storage` | ✅ Yes | local `admin` address | Referral code and tier storage. |
| `reader` | ✅ Yes | local `admin` address | View aggregation API. |
| `exchange_router` | ✅ Yes | local `admin` address | Single user entry point. |

**Upgrade workflow:**

```sh
# Single contract
make upgrade-contract CONTRACT=deposit_handler NETWORK=testnet SOURCE=deployer

# Dry-run (prints planned actions, submits nothing)
make upgrade-all DRY_RUN=1 NETWORK=testnet SOURCE=deployer

# All upgradeable contracts
make upgrade-all NETWORK=testnet SOURCE=deployer
```

`market_token` and other non-upgradeable contracts are skipped or rejected by `make upgrade-contract` and `make upgrade-all` based on lack of entrypoint.

## Protocol Glossary

Definitions for every domain term used throughout the codebase and issue tracker.
New contributors should read this before working on math, risk, or fee logic.

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Market token** | The SEP-41 LP token minted by `market_factory` for a specific market (e.g. ETH/USD). Holding market tokens represents a proportional share of the market pool. Burned on withdrawal. Also called "GM token" in the UI. |
| **Index token** | The asset whose price determines PnL for positions in a market (e.g. ETH). Not necessarily held in the pool — only its oracle price matters. |
| **Long token** | The collateral token used for long positions (and one side of the LP pool). Typically the same asset as the index token (e.g. WETH for an ETH/USD market). |
| **Short token** | The collateral token used for short positions (and the other side of the LP pool). Typically a stablecoin (e.g. USDC). |
| **Pool amount** | The protocol-tracked balance of a specific token held by a market pool. Stored in `data_store` under `pool_amount_key(market, token)`. Updated on deposit, withdrawal, and position settlement. |
| **Open interest (OI)** | The total notional USD size of all open positions on one side (long or short) of a market. Tracked separately for longs and shorts. Used to compute funding rates and ADL eligibility. |
| **Funding fee** | A periodic payment between long and short position holders to balance open interest. The dominant side pays the subordinate side. Accumulated as `funding_amount_per_size` and settled when a position is increased, decreased, or liquidated. |
| **Borrowing fee** | A fee charged to position holders for consuming pool liquidity. Proportional to position size and the fraction of the pool that is "borrowed" by open interest. Accumulated as a cumulative factor and settled on position change. |
| **ADL (Auto-Deleveraging)** | A risk-management mechanism that partially closes the most profitable positions on the winning side when the pool's total unrealised PnL exceeds a safe threshold. Triggered by an ADL keeper via `adl_handler`. |
| **Keeper** | An off-chain bot that submits transactions to execute pending requests (orders, deposits, withdrawals) and perform risk operations (liquidations, ADL). Keepers hold role-store roles such as `ORDER_KEEPER`, `LIQUIDATION_KEEPER`, and `ADL_KEEPER`. |
| **Controller** | A privileged role (`CONTROLLER`) granted to handler contracts, allowing them to write to `data_store` and withdraw from market pools. Assigned by the admin during deployment. |
| **Position** | An open leveraged trade, stored in `order_handler`'s persistent storage under `PositionStorageKey::Position(key)`. Tracks size, collateral, entry price, accumulated fee indices, and direction (long/short). |
| **Collateral token** | The token deposited by a trader to back a position. For longs, this is the long token; for shorts, the short token. Determines which pool the collateral is drawn from. |
| **Execution price** | The price at which an order is filled, adjusted for price impact. Derived from the oracle mid-price plus or minus the price impact of the trade on pool balance. |
| **Price impact** | A fee/rebate that incentivises trades that balance pool OI. Negative impact (paid by trader) is added to the impact pool; positive impact (rebate to trader) is drawn from the impact pool. |
| **Swap path** | An ordered list of market addresses through which tokens are routed in a multi-hop swap. Each hop transfers a token into one market pool and out of another. |
| **Trigger price** | The oracle price level at which a limit or stop order becomes eligible for execution. Checked by the keeper before calling `execute_order`. |
| **Acceptable price** | The worst execution price a trader will accept for a market order. Orders revert if the execution price exceeds this bound. |
| **Min collateral factor** | A market-level parameter (stored in `data_store`) that defines the minimum collateral-to-size ratio below which a position is liquidatable. Example: 0.01 means a position is liquidatable when remaining collateral falls below 1 % of its USD size. |
| **Max open interest (OI cap)** | A per-market, per-side limit on total notional USD open interest. Stored under `max_open_interest_key(market, is_long)`. Any position increase that would push OI beyond this cap reverts. A cap of 0 means uncapped. |
| **Keeper execution window** | The time gap between when a user creates a pending order and when a keeper executes it. Keepers control timing within this window; the `acceptable_price` field is the user's primary defence against adverse timing. |
| **Realised PnL** | PnL that has been settled to the trader's account upon a decrease or liquidation. Distinct from unrealised PnL, which is the mark-to-market gain/loss on an open position. |
| **Oracle** | The `oracle` contract that stores keeper-submitted, ed25519-verified price pairs (min/max) for each token. Prices are ledger-scoped — keepers must submit fresh prices each time they call an execution function. |
| **Instance storage** | Soroban storage bucket for small, frequently-accessed values (admin address, contract addresses). Subject to TTL rent — the protocol bumps TTL on every interaction. |
| **Persistent storage** | Soroban storage bucket for user-specific long-lived data (positions, orders, deposits). Also subject to TTL rent but with a longer minimum TTL. |
| **FLOAT_PRECISION** | The fixed-point scaling factor `10^30` used for all USD values and rate accumulators in the protocol. |
| **TOKEN_PRECISION** | `10^7` — Stellar's 7-decimal standard for token amounts. |
